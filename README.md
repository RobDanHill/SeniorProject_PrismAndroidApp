# SeniorProject_PrismAndroidApp
This repository contains the code for the Prism Android App used in my Senior Project.

The code here is only a piece of a bigger application. **Prism** is a multifaceted photo-sharing
application that allows hosts of large events to gather event-goers photos in a centralized
storage location on the host's computer.

- Desktop Application
- Server
- Mobile App

All of these were necessary components for Prism to be a feasible endeavor. I was responsible 
for creating one of two Android app designs. My design allows the user to take photos one at
a time, similar to SnapChat, and decide if he/she wants to send the photo to the storage location
before capturing another photo.
